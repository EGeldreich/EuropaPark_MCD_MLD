# Christmas time exercice 2

MCD and MLD oriented exercice
The goal is to handle the system in charge of visitors, attractions, and other miscellaneous things of a theme park

I chose to externalize tables as much as possible (category, intensity, status ...) to make it more complex and make it somewhat easier to use.
